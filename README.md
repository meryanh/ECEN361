# ECEN361
Final project source code.

Must be compiled with opencv2 libraries and the Raspberry Pi must be running the fully updated Raspbian Jessie OS.
servoblaster, opencv2, qt5, espeak, openbr, and aplay, along with all associated dependencies, must be installed on the Raspberry Pi before executing.

This code may produce a very unstable and unsafe executable that has a good chance of crashing the system, especially if the webcam being used is not fully compatible with the Rasiberry Pi.

Incompatible webcams will often result in false-positive movement results as well as false-negative facial recognition. This problem can be fixed by using a better webcam.
